# soc-agent

A **starter template** for a Microsoft Foundry **hosted agent** that runs the
**GitHub Copilot SDK** on a **fully private VNet**, deployed end-to-end with
`azd up`.

This repo combines two upstream projects into a single deployable solution:

- **`rodrigodemos/foundry-ghcp-hosted`** — an `azd`-managed Foundry hosted agent
  using the Copilot SDK over the `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` protocol,
  with BYOK Foundry-model auth via Managed Identity.
- **`microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples/.../19-private-network-agent-tools`** —
  the Bicep templates for a network-secured Foundry account, BYO backend
  resources (Cosmos DB / AI Search / Storage) on private endpoints, BYO VNet
  (Agent / PE / MCP subnets), Premium ACR with private endpoint, Application
  Insights with Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS), and tools behind the
  VNet (a sample MCP HTTP server).

> Light SOC theming only (agent display name and system prompt). The repo is
> **customer-agnostic** — all customer-specific data sources, MCP servers,
> cookbooks, and eval sets live in [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md) as
> future-phase work.

## Architecture (one paragraph)

`azd up` provisions: a private VNet with three subnets (Agent — delegated to
`Microsoft.App/environments`; PE — for private endpoints; MCP — for
user-deployed Container Apps), a Foundry account with `publicNetworkAccess:
Disabled` and a project that connects to BYO Cosmos DB / AI Search / Storage
over private endpoints, a Premium ACR with a private endpoint, Application
Insights with private ingestion via AMPLS, an Azure-managed capability host on
the Foundry project (no bash script needed), and a sample MCP HTTP server
Container App on the MCP subnet. `azd deploy` then builds and ships the
Copilot-SDK agent image (`src/copilot-agent`) and the MCP HTTP server image
(`src/mcp-http-server`) to the private ACR.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and
[`docs/networking.md`](docs/networking.md) for the full picture.

## Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription with permission to:
   - Create the Foundry account and project (Foundry Account Owner)
   - Assign RBAC (Owner or Role-Based Access Administrator)
   - Register the resource providers below
2. Required RPs (one-time per subscription):
   ```bash
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.KeyVault
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.CognitiveServices
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Storage
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Search
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Network
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights
   az provider register --namespace Microsoft.Insights
   ```
3. **Quota** for the model SKU in your target region. Defaults: `gpt-4o-mini`
   `GlobalStandard` cap 30 — adjust via `AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`,
   `MODEL_VERSION`, `MODEL_SKU`, `MODEL_CAPACITY` env vars.
4. Tooling:
   - [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) ≥ 2.60
   - [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) ≥ 1.10
   - Docker — required on the host that runs `azd deploy` (the MCP HTTP
     server image is built locally). Not needed on a host that only runs
     `azd provision`.
5. **Where you run `azd deploy` from** — see [Deployment paths](#deployment-paths) below. Either:
   - **In-VNet host** (recommended) — a VM inside the VNet, or one in a peered
     VNet linked to the `privatelink.azurecr.io` private DNS zone, **or**
   - **Any laptop, with a one-off ACR IP allowlist** for that workstation.

## Getting started

End-to-end happy path. Steps 1–3 run from anywhere (your laptop); step 4 depends on which [deployment path](#deployment-paths) you pick.

### 1. Clone and open the repo

```powershell
git clone <this-repo> soc-agent
cd soc-agent
```

### 2. Initialize the azd environment

```powershell
azd auth login
azd init --environment soc-agent-dev          # pick any name you like
```

That's it. The template's `preprovision` hook automatically:

- Binds **`AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`** from your active `az` context (`az account show`).
- Prompts for **`AZURE_LOCATION`** if you haven't set one (defaults to `eastus2`).

You can still pin either ahead of time if you want unattended runs:

```powershell
azd env set AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID (az account show --query id -o tsv)
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
```

Optional — set any of the `EXISTING_*_RESOURCE_ID` variables now if you're [bringing your own VNet](#using-an-existing-vnet-byo) or [backend resources](#using-existing-backend-resources).

### 3. Validate prerequisites

Run the preflight script. It checks tooling versions, your Azure login, required resource-provider registrations, model quota in the target region, and (if configured) that any BYO resources actually exist and the agent subnet is correctly delegated.

```powershell
.\scripts\check-prereqs.ps1
```

If anything fails, fix it and re-run. Common one-time fix:

```powershell
.\scripts\check-prereqs.ps1 -RegisterProviders   # registers any missing RPs
```

A clean run ends with `Passed: NN, Warnings: 0, Failures: 0`.

### 4. Provision and deploy

Pick the path that matches your environment:

**Path A — `azd up` from an in-VNet host** (single shot, recommended for repeat dev work)

```bash
# From a VM inside the VNet (or in a peered VNet with the privatelink DNS zone linked)
azd up
```

**Path B — Split (`azd provision` anywhere, `azd deploy` from in-VNet)** (bootstrapping from a laptop)

```powershell
# Step 1 — from your laptop
azd provision
```

```bash
# Step 2 — SSH / Bastion into the in-VNet host, clone the repo there, then:
cd soc-agent
azd auth login                                # or: az login --identity
azd env refresh --environment soc-agent-dev   # pulls env values from Azure
azd deploy
```

Either path takes ~25–35 minutes (most of it Foundry / capability-host provisioning on the first run).

### 5. Verify

```powershell
azd env get-values | Select-String 'FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT|AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME|MCP_HTTP_SERVER_FQDN'
```

From a VPN / Bastion host that can reach the private endpoints:

- Open the **Foundry portal** → your subscription → the new account+project → **Agents** → invoke `soc-copilot-agent` from the Playground.
- (Optional) From an in-VNet host, hit the MCP server health check:
  ```bash
  curl http://<MCP_HTTP_SERVER_FQDN>/mcp -H 'Accept: text/event-stream'
  ```

You're up. From here, swap in your own MCP tools, customize the agent system prompt in `src/copilot-agent/main.py`, and work through the items in [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md).

## Deployment paths

Because the Azure Container Registry is provisioned with **public network access disabled**, the `docker push` step in `azd deploy` only succeeds from a host that can reach the ACR private endpoint. The provision step is unaffected — Azure Resource Manager is always public.

That gives you two supported workflows:

### Path A — Split: `azd provision` from anywhere, `azd deploy` from in-VNet

Use this when you're bootstrapping from a laptop or a build PC that lives outside the target VNet.

```powershell
# ── Step 1 — From your laptop (anywhere) ─────────────────────────────────
azd auth login
azd init --environment soc-agent-dev
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
azd provision                  # creates VNet, Foundry, private endpoints, ACR, etc.
```

```bash
# ── Step 2 — From a VM / Bastion host inside the VNet (or a peered VNet) ─
git clone <this-repo>
cd soc-agent
azd auth login                 # or: az login --identity (VM SMI granted AcrPush)
azd env refresh --environment soc-agent-dev   # pulls the env values from Azure
azd deploy                     # builds + pushes images, updates the agent + ACA app
```

What the in-VNet host needs:
- DNS for `<acr>.azurecr.io` resolves to the **private IP** in the PE subnet
  (true automatically if the VM is in the same VNet; if it's in a peered VNet,
  link the `privatelink.azurecr.io` private DNS zone there too).
- An identity with `AcrPush` on the registry (interactive `az login` user,
  managed identity, or a service principal).
- `azd`, `az`, and Docker installed.

### Path B — Single shot: `azd up` from in-VNet

If your dev environment is already a VM inside the VNet (e.g., a Bastion-accessible jump box you keep around for SOC work), just run `azd up` from there and it handles both provision and deploy in one go:

```bash
# From the in-VNet VM
azd auth login
azd init --environment soc-agent-dev
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus2
azd up
```

### After deployment (either path)

- The Foundry **portal** is reachable from a VPN / ExpressRoute / Bastion host
  that can resolve `privatelink.services.ai.azure.com` against the private
  endpoint. From the public internet, the Foundry account is **not reachable**.
- The Copilot-SDK hosted agent is callable from the **Foundry Playground** in
  your project. It runs as a Container App on the Agent subnet.
- The sample MCP HTTP server is reachable **inside the VNet** at
  `MCP_HTTP_SERVER_FQDN:80` (see `azd env get-values`).

### Alternative: dev-only IP allowlist on ACR

For one-off dev or demos where standing up an in-VNet build host is overkill, you can temporarily open the ACR firewall to your workstation's public IP. Set `DEVELOPER_IP_CIDR` **before** `azd provision` and `azd deploy` will be able to push from your laptop:

```powershell
azd env set DEVELOPER_IP_CIDR "$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)/32"
azd up
```

When set, `infra/modules/registry/container-registry.bicep` flips ACR to `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled` with a **default-deny firewall plus a single allow rule for that CIDR**. Don't use this in production — clear it (`azd env set DEVELOPER_IP_CIDR ""` then `azd provision`) when you're done. See [`docs/networking.md`](docs/networking.md) for the trade-offs and notes on ACR Tasks with private registries.

### Switching between private and public Foundry access

The Foundry account is created with `publicNetworkAccess: Disabled` and
`defaultAction: Deny`. To flip it to public during dev:

```bash
# in infra/modules/ai/ai-account-identity.bicep
# change:  publicNetworkAccess: 'Disabled'  →  'Enabled'
# change:  defaultAction: 'Deny'            →  'Allow'
azd provision
```

Backend resources (Cosmos / Search / Storage / ACR / AppInsights) remain on
private endpoints in both modes.

### Using an existing VNet (BYO)

Set the following before `azd up`:

```powershell
azd env set EXISTING_VNET_RESOURCE_ID         "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet>"
azd env set EXISTING_AGENT_SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet>/subnets/<agent-subnet>"
azd env set EXISTING_PE_SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID    "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet>/subnets/<pe-subnet>"
azd env set EXISTING_MCP_SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID   "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet>/subnets/<mcp-subnet>"
```

The agent subnet **must** be exclusively delegated to
`Microsoft.App/environments` and unused by any other resource. See
[`docs/networking.md`](docs/networking.md) for sizing guidance.

### Using existing backend resources

Set any of these to reuse existing Cosmos DB / AI Search / Storage accounts:

```powershell
azd env set EXISTING_AZURE_COSMOS_DB_ACCOUNT_RESOURCE_ID "<ARM ID>"
azd env set EXISTING_AI_SEARCH_RESOURCE_ID               "<ARM ID>"
azd env set EXISTING_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_RESOURCE_ID   "<ARM ID>"
```

## Cleanup

```powershell
azd down --purge --force
```

`--purge` matters: the Foundry account is soft-deleted by default, and the
capability host blocks re-use of the agent subnet until the account is purged.
Allow up to ~20 minutes for full cleanup. The `scripts/deleteCapHost.sh`
script is provided as an escape hatch if you want to delete the capability
host without deleting the account.

## What's *not* in this template (yet)

Phase 2+ features live in [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md): additional MCP
servers (e.g. Sentinel, ServiceNow), A2A agent, Azure Functions MCP, federated
search tool contract, cookbook catalog, eval framework, MCP hosting bake-off
(Functions vs Logic Apps vs APIM), multi-environment promotion, KQL generation
tool.
